In my role, I handled user interface analysis, developed user flows, designed interfaces, managed documentation processes, and implemented features for the rebranding of V+ into a super app offering multiple services.
                <br> <br>
              Even though the app initially drew a lot of users, its usage decreased over time. Given that V+ was a relatively new product (2 years old) post-rebranding, it still held onto its old identity and had a lot flops, leading to a less-than-ideal user experience as an Over-The-Top (OTT) app. <b class="secondary-black">The challenge we faced was evident: How could we elevate the current app's user experience?</b></p>

            <p>To have Vision+ as a leading streaming services app and transform it into a super app, we had to enhance the overall user experience of the V+ app. Simultaneously, we must develop new features for Vision+ to make it a comprehensive super app (this part can be unlocked by password). It's crucial to ensure that every feature is easily accessible and enjoyable for all users.</p>

            <p>While reviewing the product, we noticed several areas that needed <b class="secondary-black">improvement</b>, especially in terms of users understanding the app at a basic level. Many features <b class="secondary-black">lacked clear use cases, failed at creating a balance between security and user experience, and there were inconsistencies, with some features being "invisible" to users</b>. I suspected that these issues might be the reason why users weren't purchasing our packages regularly and why the app failed to captivate them, despite matching their content preferences. In response, our team divided tasks, and this page highlights some of the tasks I took on to address these challenges.</p>

            <p>The payment feature in this app had some glaring issues: <b class="secondary-black">(1) it lacked clear instructions for pending, failed, or successful payments, (2) the users couldn't view payment details.</b> These problems stemmed from an incomplete user flow at the beginning. To address this, I ensured to create a comprehensive user flow and designed the screens accordingly.</p>

            <p>In enhancing this feature, I added <b class="secondary-black">more entry points to other features</b>, making it easier for users to discover and find the package offerings interesting.

            <p>To log into the app, users have to enter a verification code sent via SMS (OTP). The issue we discovered is that currently, <b class="secondary-black">users could enter the OTP an unlimited number of times</b>. This poses a significant security risk, especially if an unauthorized user, like a hacker, attempts to gain access. Without safety mechanisms, <b class="secondary-black">a hacker could quickly generate and input multiple OTP patterns</b> in a short time, easily taking over a user account.
              <br> <br>
            I proposed several solutions to address this problem, but some of them were not feasible due to limited resources and technical constraints.</p>

Unfortunately, I've identified issues with how users access the VOD player feature. Specifically, users can't stream videos in vertical mode, causing inconvenience, as many users also prefer this orientation. Additionally, users experience significant lag while streaming live videos, although this falls beyond the scope of the design team. Regardless, <b class="secondary-black">prioritizing the end results and satisfaction of users remains our paramount concern.</b>

Fueled by the prolonged pandemic, people are turning to gaming for entertainment, leading to significant user growth. Rapid technological advancements further enhance the gaming experience. Recognizing this,

            Vision+ plans to expand by <b class="secondary-black">introducing gaming features</b> in Vision+ 2.0. Users can enjoy web-based casual games by MNC Games, adding gamification features to the app. This move aims to attract more users and align with industry trends.
              <br> <br>
            Armed with this information, I conducted a <b class="secondary-black">competitive analysis</b> of key players like Amazon Prime, Google Stadia, and Apple Arcade. My goal was to not only understand the market but also <b class="secondary-black">expand our target audience</b>. Based on this analysis and the desire to broaden our user base, I formulated several features, including profile customization, a referral program, daily missions, loyalty points, and in-app item purchases.

            <p>In UI/UX design, there are common practices like creating user flows, sitemaps, user persona, and many more. Through this experience, I learned that <b class="secondary-black">not every product needs to strictly follow these practices</b> especially if the product is on the different stage (in this case, the product is in growth stage rather than a brand-new product). Each fundamental process has its unique goals and functions. I believe it's crucial to <b class="secondary-black">use the right tools for the right purpose</b>.
              <br> <br>
            Another lesson learned is the importance of <b class="secondary-black">balancing metrics for users</b>. In a streaming service, user comfort is paramount. Users should feel at ease while using the service, ensuring a positive experience, while the business still benefits from user engagement.</p>
