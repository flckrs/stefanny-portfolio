              <p class="case-section-content">As the name suggest, <b class="secondary-black">CV screening system</b> is a system that screen candidate CVs and find he right candidates using AI. This project is all about <b class="secondary-black">utilizing AI to make HR's job easier</b>, especially when screening CVs. One big reason for this is that HR has to go through many CVs over and over for job openings. Knowing this takes a lot of time, my design project is working to make this process <b class="secondary-black">faster and better.</b>
              <br> <br>
              The current tools, called Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), are helpful but not perfect. People find them tricky and not easy to use, so they end up going back to doing things manually. Our project is working on making the part of ATS that deals with CV screening much better and simpler.</p>

This exploration helps me prepare the right questions for interviews with both stakeholders and users. I also <b class="secondary-black">checked out similar products</b>, and here's what I found:
              <br> <br>
            1.<b class="secondary-black"> Many of our market competitors have a steep learning curve</b>. Users need to navigate through multiple steps to achieve their goals, which could be simplified.
              <br> <br>
            2.<b class="secondary-black"> The visual design for users is pretty dull</b>. These products are bland because they present a lot of text, and users have to do a ton of scrolling just to fill in the necessary info.

            It's like a map—we talk, we listen, and we navigate through the user's experience to find areas that need improvement. Talking is our compass in discovering what works, what doesn't, and how we can make things better for everyone.</p>

            <h2 class="case-section-title">Research - HR View</h2>
            <p>To get a better grip on our users (HR professionals), I dug deeper by conducting <b class="secondary-black">interviews</b> with various <b class="secondary-black">HR experts</b> from different companies, each with their unique roles. In this phase of the research, I <b class="secondary-black">gathered information</b> on their activities, problems, goals, tasks, and user needs to figure out the key features for the designs.
              <br> <br>
            From these interviews, a couple of things stood out:
              <br> <br>
            1. The CV screening process <b class="secondary-black">isn't</b> as <b class="secondary-black">straightforward</b> as I initially thought, especially because every HR pro has their own way of doing it.
              <br>
            2. Users of the product are <b class="secondary-black">meticulous and thorough</b>. They always double-check to make sure they're getting the right information from the CVs.
              <br>
            3. Most users are familiar with <b class="secondary-black">email apps</b> and various <b class="secondary-black">recruitment platforms</b>, such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc.
              <br> <br>
            When I interviewed users, I took care not to mix up what they want with what they need because these fall into different categories. It's important to understand that <b class="secondary-black">what people say might not fully capture their feelings, needs, or thoughts</b>. This stage is crucial for me to nail down the user requirements.</p>

I need to make sure the entire screening process happens on one screen without jumping from page to page. This helps users <b class="secondary-black">track the process easily</b>, especially since it can be quite lengthy, as shown in the image above.

            <p>I've talked over all the features with the dev team, and the stakeholders gave us the green light.

            <p>The challenge here is to <b class="secondary-black">design all of the features</b> as the image shown above in a way that fulfills UX and usability goals, ensuring users aren't overwhelmed. To tackle this, I'm <b class="secondary-black">grouping features, considering the HR process</b>. It's tricky since I need to ensure every crucial tool is easily accessible by the user. I'm breaking down the design into phases:
              <br> <br>
            <b class="secondary-black">Phase 1</b>: Creating a sitemap to group features.
            <br>
            <b class="secondary-black">Phase 2</b>: Mapping out the user flow for the entire product, connecting different features.
            <br>
            <b class="secondary-black">Phase 3</b>: Detailing the user flow for each feature.
            <br>
            <b class="secondary-black">Phase 4</b>: Outlining use cases diagram for developers.
              <br> <br>
            I believe it's crucial to <b class="secondary-black">approach design</b> from <b class="secondary-black">various angles</b>, so each perspective complements the others and makes the development process smoother.</p>

            <h2 class="case-section-title">Design Principles</h2>
            <p>Once I've chosen the features, defined solid foundation, and figured out how the product will work for users, the next step is to <b class="secondary-black">bring the product to life</b>. As I shape the design, a <b class="secondary-black">set of principles</b> is my North Star—they guide both major and minor design decisions. These principles play a crucial role in achieving the user experience I aim for in the product.
              <br> <br>
            hese principles encompass anticipating user needs, minimizing cognitive load, adopting a modular system, purposeful use of color, prioritizing clarity, recognizing the importance of context, placing relevance first, and choosing the right wording for the right user.</p>

            <p>Guided by these principles, I experimented with various ways to <b class="secondary-black">present</b> all the <b class="secondary-black">essential candidate information</b>. I tested side-bar menus, candidate info in list views, horizontal lists, and many more. Among these options, I settled on one featuring a <b class="secondary-black">navigation bar for the menu and a single container displaying multiple candidates with CV file previews beside each</b>.
              <br> <br>
            Initially, I thought it might be ideal to show all the candidates' basic info at once and then reveal the CV after a user click.
              <br> <br>
            However, considering the meticulous nature of users, it seemed more effective to place the CV preview on the same page as the list of candidates. This ensures a seamless and <b class="secondary-black">efficient experience</b> for users who prefer to <b class="secondary-black">carefully review information</b>.</p>

        <div class="case-section-wrapper">
          <div class="case-section-wrapper-1">
            <p>I also make sure to <b class="secondary-black">cover all potential scenarios</b> for each component, screen, or click that users might engage with. This helps <b class="secondary-black">prevent confusion</b> during unsuccessful interactions. I've created numerous cases that are crucial, including scenarios for new users, instances where users upload files, and many more to cover the primary interactions. This thorough approach <b class="secondary-black">ensures a smooth experience and addresses various user needs and actions within the product</b>.
              <br> <br>

            Since this product deals with <b class="secondary-black">sensitive data</b>, there's always a <b class="secondary-black">pop-up</b> (modal) when users <b class="secondary-black">perform important actions</b>. This is especially true when users change a candidate's status, alter position status, delete candidate data, and more. Additionally, I've ensured the product has a temporary trash section for added security. This section ensures that data isn't permanently deleted but <b class="secondary-black">is kept in a temporary trash bin for 30 days</b> after the user decides to delete it. This way, even sensitive data has an extra layer of protection and can be recovered if needed within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <p>Based on what I've learned, users in the recruitment process often use various applications like <b class="secondary-black">LinkedIn</b> and <b class="secondary-black">email</b>. To make the product easy to learn, I've <b class="secondary-black">aligned its functions and usage with familiar behaviors</b>. For instance, I added a filter function for searching candidates, similar to the filter button in email apps.
              <br> <br>
            I've also considered <b class="secondary-black">how users interact on desktops</b>, recognizing that their actions might differ unconsciously across platforms. In this design, I ensure users can perform shortcut actions by clicking the right mouse button. This not only provides alternative ways for users to achieve their goals but also gives them the experience of using a familiar desktop application.
              <br> <br>
            In finalizing the product, I ensure that<b class="secondary-black"> micro-interactions</b> are included to make the user experience more <b class="secondary-black">intuitive and engaging</b>. This is crucial, especially considering users interact with numerous items on the screen. Additionally, I make sure each button has its unique micro-interaction tailored to its hierarchy. For example, primary buttons and secondary buttons have distinct micro-interactions. This not only adds a touch of <b class="secondary-black">dynamism</b> to the product but also guides users through a seamless and interactive experience based on the importance of each action.</p>

Another discovery was that certain actions needed more visibility.

            After making improvements, <b class="secondary-black">the subsequent test showed a 39.1% increase in time-based efficiency, 100% completion of tasks without errors, and the product being easy to learn</b>, supported by SEQ (Single Ease Question) data and learning curve information indicating users' skill improvement while using the products.

            The tests also revealed that users found the product engaging and delightful, thanks to its intuitiveness and the "<b class="secondary-black">aesthetic-usability</b>" effect it brought.</p>

            <p>Design is all about making <b class="secondary-black">user-centric decisions</b>, distinguishing between biased and unbiased input. Throughout this UI/UX design journey, I've gained significant insights, and here are a few key takeaways:
              <br> <br>
            1. <b class="secondary-black">Empathy Matters</b>: Always understand the user's perspective. It not only guides the product creation process but helps in crafting products that resonate with the user's mental model, making it more relatable and user-friendly.
              <br> <br>
            2. <b class="secondary-black">Evolution of Ideas</b>: What I envisioned in the discovery stage looked quite different in the final product. The journey unfolded new layers, emphasizing the importance of continuous exploration and refinement, resulting in a more refined final design.
              <br> <br>
            3. <b class="secondary-black">Balancing Stakeholders and Developers</b>: Meeting the needs of stakeholders and users is crucial, but equally important is aligning designs with developers' capabilities. Making components reusable ensures efficiency and adaptability, benefiting both developers and the overall design process.
              <br> <br>
            4. <b class="secondary-black">The Power of Aesthetics</b>: The aesthetic usability effect is a game-changer. It's not just about looks; it profoundly shapes how users perceive a product's usability and functionality. A well-designed and visually pleasing interface boosts user engagement, creating positive associations and increasing user retention rates.</p>
